Forwarding a sablono description of a world from the client to the browser

That description includes a clojurescript namespace

Need to load its dependencies from the server

This part is a fairly drastic side-track.

Merged what I had up to this point back into master, even though
it NPE's there.

Need to get that part working, really in a separate branch, before
I can even think about the rendering again.

This is really just a note about where I am now.
